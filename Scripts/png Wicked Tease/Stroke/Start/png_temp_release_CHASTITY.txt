#GreetSub
How are you doing in your little cage?
[yes,fine,good,great]Oh so that means I can keep you there even longer then #Grin
[ok,okay,not very good,not so good,not so great,need to stroke]Oh starting to feel the weight of being under my total control #Grin
[no,badly,bad,terrible,horrible,let me free,free me,need to be free]Oh that's a very good thing #Grin
@DifferentAnswer are you doing fine or not?
But today is your lucky day!
I'll let you free of your #ChastityCage for today's session
Aren't you lucky? #Grin
[yes]Of course you are, you are <i>my</i> #PetName afterall #lol
[no]Ohhh, you don't think you are @Goto(no_freedom)
@DifferentAnswer are you lucky or not?
I bet it will feel so good to finally touch your #Cock after being in your #ChastityCage @TempFlag(png__temporary_freedom) @ChastityOff
(cage_off_lopp)
@Wait(30)
Are you ready to continue?
[yes]Let's do it then
[no]I thought you'd be faster than that to get out @Goto(cage_off_lopp)
@DifferentAnswer Maybe I should just keep you locked in the end... @Goto(cage_off_lopp)
Let's start stroking #PetName @StartStroking
@End
(no_freedom)
Then no freedom for you!
Instead I'll just make you write lines @AFKOn
(writing_punishment)
@NullResponse @WritingTask(I am so lucky to have #DomHonorific #DomName keeping me in chastity)
Alright time to start teasing you then since you don't think you are a lucky #PetName @AFKOff @StartTaunts
(Failed Writing Task)
Wow you can't even do that right...
Redo it until you get it right! @Goto(writing_punishment)
@Info The dom frees you from chastity to let you stroke
