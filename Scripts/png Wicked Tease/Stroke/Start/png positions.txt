#GreetSub
Before we start I want to know if you are already naked or still wearing your clothes?
[yes,naked,bare]Good @Goto(naked)
[no,wearing,clothes]How dare you present yourself before me still wearing clothes #PetName? @Goto(strip)
@DifferentAnswer are you naked yes or no?
(naked)
I want you completely naked #GeneralTime! #Grin
Today you're gonna work on some slave positions
That way if one day you come to serve me for real you'll already be trained
Let's see... @CheckFlag(png__position_stand,png__position_kneel,png__position_beg,png__position_worship,png__position_nadu)
Since you don't know any position we will start with an easy one #Grin
I call this one 'stand' @SetFlag(png__position_stand)
(learn_stand)
When I tell you 'stand #PetName' I want you to stand up, your back straight
Your feet slightly apart
Your hands crossed being your back palms outward
Your head bowed down
It's almost like an 'at ease' position in the military
You need to be able to keep this one for a while since it will be your default position
From now on it's also your position if I tell you to stand in a corner
So when I give you the order I want you to stand in front of the screen until I tell you to sit back down
@RapidTextOn Let's try
Stand #PetName @Wait(60)
Keep your back straight @Wait(60)
Remember to look down @Wait(60)
Keep it a bit longer @Wait(60)
Imagine staying hours like this for me #Grin @Wait(30)
Waiting for my orders @Wait(30)
Alright you can sit down @RapidTextOff @Goto(position_done)
(png__position_stand)
Do you remember the 'Stand' position #PetName?
[yes,I do]Good
[no,I don't]Oh, we'll need to retrain you then! @Goto(forgot_stand)
@DifferentAnswer Do you or not?
Stand #PetName @Wait(60)
You can sit down again
Now time for a new one! #Grin
(learn_kneel)
This one is called 'kneel' @SetFlag(png__position_kneel)
So when I tell you 'Kneel #PetName' I want you on your knees
Your knees and ankles touching each other
Your back straight
Your hands crossed being your back, palms outward
Your head bowed down
If I want you to keep this one for a long time I'll tell you to get a pillow for under your knees
And if you get punished the pillow can be replaced by rice or frozen peas
Trust me after a few minutes kneeling on rice you'll be a lot more obedient #lol
Let's try it
Don't worry, the classical one, not in punishment mode #Grin
@RapidTextOn Kneel #PetName @Wait(60)
With some training you'll be able to hold it a lot longer without any pillow @Wait(30)
Alright you can sit down @RapidTextOff @Goto(position_done)
(png__position_kneel)
You are supposed to know two positions by now @Chance50(beg_try_kneel)
Stand #PetName @Wait(60) @Chance25(beg_try_kneel) @Goto(beg_skip_kneel)
(beg_try_kneel)
Kneel #PetName @Wait(60)
(beg_skip_kneel)
Sit down again
Time to learn a third one
(learn_beg)
This one is the 'beg' position @SetFlag(png__position_beg)
It's also a kneeling position
But this time Your knees are slightly apart around 10 inches/25 centimeters
Sitting on your heels, back straight
Hands on your lap, palms up
And head up, eyes looking down
Each time you have something to ask me, or if I tell you to beg me, I want you in this position! #Grin @ShowImage[png/beg.jpg] @UnlockImages
Let's try it
@RapidTextOn Beg me orally to let you stroke #PetName @Wait(30)
Not convincing enough, beg harder @Wait(30)
Alright, good enough. You can sit down @RapidTextOff @Goto(position_done)
(png__position_beg)
Your training is coming along nicely #PetName
I hope you remember all the positions you learned so far...
Do you remember all three?
[yes]Good @Chance33(worship_try_kneel)
[no]I wonder what I'll do with you... @Goto(forgot_position)
@DifferentAnswer yes or no?
@NullResponse @Chance50(worship_try_beg)
Stand #PetName @Wait(60) @Chance25(worship_try_kneel) 
@NullResponse @Chance25(worship_try_beg) @Goto(worship_skip)
(worship_try_kneel)
Kneel #PetName @Wait(60) @Chance25(worship_try_beg) @Goto(worship_skip)
(worship_try_beg)
Beg me orally to teach you a new position #PetName @Wait(60)
(worship_skip)
Sit down again
Now we are getting to a more advanced position
(learn_worship)
The next one is the 'worship' position @SetFlag(png__position_worship)
You'll do this one each time I tell you to worship me or to pray to me
It's basically the praying position of the Muslims
Kneeling, knees together
Head down, your forehead touching ground
Your arms stretched in front of you reaching far
Your hands together palm down touching the floor @ShowImage[png/worship.jpg] @UnlockImages
Let's try it
Worship me by saying out loud "I will always obey, love and worship #DomHonorific #DomName " 20 times @Wait(90)
I know you will #PetName #Grin
And in exchange I promise that I will always make you ache for me! #lol @Goto(position_done)
(png__position_worship)
It's time for my favorite position!
But before that...
Do you remember all four positions you learned?
[yes]Good @Chance25(nadu_try_kneel)
[no]I wonder what I'll do with you... @Goto(forgot_position)
@DifferentAnswer yes or no?
@NullResponse @Chance25(nadu_try_beg)
@NullResponse @Chance25(nadu_try_worship)
Stand #PetName @Wait(60) @Chance25(nadu_try_kneel) 
@NullResponse @Chance25(nadu_try_beg)
@NullResponse @Chance25(nadu_try_worship) @Goto(nadu_skip)
(nadu_try_kneel)
Kneel #PetName @Wait(60) @Chance25(nadu_try_beg)
@NullResponse @Chance25(nadu_try_worship) @Goto(nadu_skip)
(nadu_try_beg)
Beg me orally to teach you a new position #PetName @Wait(60) @Chance25(nadu_try_worship) @Goto(nadu_skip)
(nadu_try_worship)
Worship me by saying out loud 'Thank you #DomHonorific #DomName for teaching me new positions' 10 times @Wait(45) @Goto(nadu_skip)
(nadu_skip)
Sit down #PetName
Now back to your new position
(learn_nadu)
I call this one 'Nadu' since it's inspired by the Gorrean slave position @SetFlag(png__position_nadu)
And if you don't know about Gor and the gorrean slaves you should look it up on internet later #Grin
So for this one, you will be kneeling
Knees as far apart as you can and feet together
Sitting on your heels
Your back arched and your head straight
Hands behind your head with your fingers locked @ShowImage[png/nadu.jpg] @UnlockImages
I love this one because it leaves you completely exposed
Totally vulnerable and submissive to me #Grin
Let's see how you do
Nadu #PetName @Wait(30)
Keep your back arched and your knees spread! @Wait(30)
Alright sit down @Goto(position_done)
(png__position_nadu)
I don't have any more positions for you for now
But that doesn't mean we can skimp on your training
Practice makes perfect after all, well perfect practice that is.
And I'm sure you want to be a perfect #PetName for me #Grin

So let's start stroking #PetName @StartStroking
@End
(forgot_stand)
But before that... @CBTCock @Goto(learn_stand)

@AcceptAnswer It seems you can't even say which one so it's best we start again from the beginning @Goto(learn_stand)
(strip)
You're off to a bad start, but we can still fix that @CBTCock
Ok now your mistake has been forgiven #Grin
You can go take off your clothes so we can start for real #lol
(puting_cloth_loop)
Are you ready?
[yes]Alright @Goto(naked)
[no]Then why are you talking to me? @Goto(puting_cloth_loop)
@DifferentAnswer I don't want you to talk I want you to take your clothes off! @Goto(puting_cloth_loop)
@Info The dom makes you learn slave positions for her. 5 positions to learn, 1 learned each time you get the script
