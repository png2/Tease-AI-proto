Wow it seems you can't even complete simple tasks when I am not there to supervise you... @AFKOff
Let's teach this #Cock of yours a lesson @CBTCock
Now that we are both ready let's begin!

But I have an idea!
It's time you make some good use of your <i>huge</i> collection of #Pictures #Grin
I'll start a slideshow while I am gone
And to make it more fun...
(slideshow_start)
When you see #png__slideshow_edge_part, #png__slideshow_variations #Grin
You'll have to be careful on your timing #lol

@RapidTextOff You're done @UnlockImages @AFKOff
Did you miss me?
[yes] That's cute #PetName, let's start right way then #Grin
[no] Oh really ? Then maybe I shall let you continue for a while @Goto(punish)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no ?
#StartStroking @StartStroking

Dream on #PetName!
Instead you'll write some lines #lol @WritingTask(I always miss my #DomHonorific when She is not with me!)
#Okay enough for now
#StartStroking @StartStroking

@Info Did you think the Dom was at your disposal? Sometimes she is busy when you contact her but since she is nice she'll either make you write lines or make you watch a JOI video to keep you busy while she is AFK
