You know what just occurred to me? @CheckFlag(BallDiskSpace)
Balls are a lot like a hard drive
But instead of data
They store all that ache I've been sending your way
Think about it
You start looking at sexy pictures @ShowImage
You like what you see @ShowImage
So you download a picture here @ShowImage
A picture there @ShowImage
And slowly but surely @ShowImage
All that space begins to fill up @ShowImage
Until there's no room left at all #EmoteRandom @ShowImage
Hold on a second, I'm getting a notification @SetFlag(BallDiskSpace)
"You are running low on space in #SubName's balls. Would you like to delete some ache?"
No thanks #Lol
#StartStroking @StartStroking
@End
(BallDiskSpace)
Your #Balls might have some more space on them since the last time I stored some ache there
I should save a few more pictures there #Grin
Like this one @ShowImage
Maybe this one @ShowImage
Definitely this one @ShowImage
Am I running out of space yet #EmoteRandom @ShowImage
I think I can fit a few more @ShowImage
Can't leave this one @ShowImage
Or this one @ShowImage @Chance50(Compress The Data)
We might have to upgrade you to some bigger balls #Lol @ShowImage @Chance50(Other Than Blue)
#StartStroking @StartStroking
@End
(Compress The Data)
We might have to get you a ball vice
That way we can compress all that data #Lol
Yeah I know, that's a groaner
But it's nothing compared to this
Start stroking #Grin @StartStroking
@End
(Other Than Blue)
I'm just curious if the newer models come in colors other than blue #EmoteRandom
#StartStroking @StartStroking
@End
@Info The domme teases you about how sexy pictures make balls fill up with ache the same way they fill hard drives up with data, and shows you a few random blog images from URL Files to drive her point home. Written by 1885.
