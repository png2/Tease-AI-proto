Sometimes I feel like a vampire
But instead of your blood, I feed on your ache! #Grin
Tasting all its flavors
Always different
Sometimes it's pain flavored
Sometimes it's frustration
Almost always there is a hint of lust
And an overwhelming taste of pleasure #Grin
Because we both know you love all the things I do to you
And you don't just let me feast on you
#No, you can't live without me #EmoteHappy
But I'm not a parasite
I'm more a symbiont
We both benefit from it after all
You bring me pleasure and power
And I make you stronger
More submissive
More obedient
Giving you purpose in life
And making you a perfect #PetName #Grin
And right now, I need a snack...
So let's get you #Stroking for me #lol @StartStroking
