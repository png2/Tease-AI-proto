@NullResponse @CheckFlag(png__kneeling)
You know what I find #Hot?
Seeing you kneeling for me! #Grin
So get on your knees and start stroking @TempFlag(png__kneeling) @StartStroking
@End
(png__kneeling)
Are you still kneeling for me #PetName?
[yes]Good! @Goto(kneeling)
[no]I don't remember telling you to get up... @Goto(punishment)
@DifferentAnswer are you kneeling yes or no?
(kneeling)
I like it when you are an obedient #PetName
Now should I let you get up or not? I wonder... @Chance33(get_up)
#No you are too cute on your knees #Grin
I'd rather have you stay there #lol
Start stroking again @StartStroking
@End
(punishment)
I'll have to punish you!
But first get back on your knees #Now!
Then let's start by teaching this #Cock what happens when you disobey... @CBTCock
Now those #Balls @CBTBalls
And you better stay on your knees until I say otherwise! 
You can start #Stroking #PetName @StartStroking
@End
(get_up)
Alright, I'll let you get back on your chair for now @DeleteFlag(png__kneeling)
But I might change my mind so keep this pillow close by #Grin @Chance33(get_up_temporary)
And you can start stroking again @StartStroking
@End
(get_up_temporary)
And you can start stroking again @StartStroking @BookmarkLink
@End
I think you were a lot cuter when you were kneeling for me... #Grin
So I changed my mind and I want you back on your knees! #lol @TempFlag(png__kneeling)
Yes I can be feeble and I know you like me that way #Emote
And since I am nice you can stroke again @StartStroking
@End
@Info Either makes you kneel if you are not, let you sit down again or keep you kneeling
