I know you enjoy this, otherwise you wouldn't be here
But I know that sometimes
There will be a part of you that wants to run
A very primal part of your manhood that fears the surrender
And trembles at the ache I'm filling you with
Urging you to run, to seek shelter and be safe
It's okay to feel that sometimes
But when you feel that rising up inside you
I want you to fight it
Fight the urge to run and hide
To make yourself safe
I want you to walk out into the open
Naked
Exposed
And completely throbbing
And I want you to beg me to keep you from feeling "safe"
And no matter how unnatural those words feel coming out of your mouth
When I tell you to wrap your hand around that tortured cock
And you feel how hard it gets at my words
You'll know that you'll never be safe from me
And you'll never <i>want</i> to be #Grin
