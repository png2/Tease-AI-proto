@ApathyLevel1 It's okay if you can't handle this #PetName, just ask me to let you stop
@ApathyLevel2 Am I being too hard on you? I'll <i>probably</i> let you stop if you ask #Grin
@ApathyLevel3 I don't know, I like being a tease more than I like being merciful sometimes #Grin
@ApathyLevel4 You want mercy? I don't even know what that word means #Lol
@ApathyLevel5 Be quiet #PetName, you don't have a say in what happens to that #Cock
@ApathyLevel3 I wouldn't be much of a tease if I went easy on you, would I? #Grin
@ApathyLevel3 I don't know if I'm really feeling merciful #GeneralTime
@ApathyLevel3 Maybe I don't <i>want</i> to show you any mercy #Grin

@ApathyLevel1 Isn't this break merciful enough? #Grin
@ApathyLevel2 Isn't this break merciful enough? #Grin
@ApathyLevel3 Isn't this break merciful enough? #Grin
@ApathyLevel4 I let you stop, didn't I?
@ApathyLevel5 This kinda <i>is</i> mercy. If I had my way, you'd be stroking that #Cock 24/7 #Lol
@ApathyLevel1 But I'm so close to letting you stroke again #Grin
@ApathyLevel2 But I'm so close to letting you stroke again #Grin
@ApathyLevel3 But I'm so close to letting you stroke again #Grin

@ApathyLevel3 You shouldn't be asking for mercy when I'm letting you have this little break
@ApathyLevel4 Mercy? Pffft you're lucky I'm even letting you have this little break #EmoteFlustered
@ApathyLevel5 I will never show that #Cock mercy. Period 
[Not Stroking End]
[Edging]
I'm letting you get close to that orgasm you want so much, aren't I? #EmoteRandom
You don't need mercy #PetName, you just need to edge
Get closer for me and I'll <i>really</i> make you beg for mercy #EmoteRandom
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
You don't want mercy now do you, what if I'm about to let you cum?
But I love it when you suffer on the edge like this! #EmoteRandom
No mercy for you #PetName, just suffering on that sweet edge for me
[Holding The Edge End]
[CBT Cock]
That #Cock doesn't need mercy, it needs more pain
If I let you stop smacking it, you'll just have to go right back to stroking it #EmoteRandom
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
But they make such tempting targets! #EmoteRandom
Thinking about how vulnerable and sensitive your balls are doesn't make me feel merciful. It makes me feel evil #EmoteRandom
[CBT Balls End]
[After Tease]
No promises #PetName #EmoteRandom
