[can't handle, can't take, can't cope, can't endure, can't bear, don't know take, don't think take, don't bear, don't endure, can't do it, don't can] 
[First Round]
But we're only getting started #PetName #EmoteRandom
It's <i>way</i> too early to start talking like that #PetName #EmoteRandom
You better find a way, we have a <i>long</i> way to go yet #EmoteRandom
[First Round End]
[Stroking]
Really? Cause I was kinda going easy on you #EmoteRandom
But knowing you can't handle it is what makes it so much fun for me #EmoteRandom
Trust me #PetName, you're nowhere near your limits yet
Too bad #PetName, there's no mercy for you here #EmoteRandom
Awww if only I had any sympathy for you and that #Cock
Too bad, you'll just have to keep stroking anyway
I bet I can make you handle even way more than you think you can #EmoteRandom
[Stroking End]
[Not Stroking]
I want you to be strong enough to please me
You'll feel whatever I want you to feel
This is what it means to please me #SubName
You might want to toughen up that #Cock because it doesn't get any easier #EmoteRandom
[Not Stroking End]
[Edging]
Good to know #Grin
Your #Cock will feel what I want it to feel whether you can handle it or not
If you're struggling now, just wait until you actually reach the edge #EmoteRandom
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
Sure you can take this #PetName. Just don't think about how close you are right now #EmoteRandom
I don't <i>want</i> you to be able to handle being this close #EmoteRandom
You better fight it. I don't want you anywhere else but right on the edge
You can and you will
[Holding The Edge End]
[CBT Cock]
I think your cock can take more for me #EmoteRandom
I'm willing to bet that #Cock is more resilient than you give it credit for #EmoteRandom
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
Actually you'd be surprised just how much those balls <i>can</i> take #EmoteRandom
I know your balls can't take it, that's why it's so much fun abusing them #EmoteRandom
[CBT Balls End]
[After Tease]
You'll handle it for me #SubName
Just promise me you'll be good until we play again #EmoteRandom
Stay strong for me #PetName
[After Tease End]
