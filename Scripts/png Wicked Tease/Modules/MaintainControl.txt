Stop stroking @StopStroking
You know what I really love?
The control you maintain over that #Cock
Getting so close
Knowing how fucking <i>good</i> it would feel if you just let yourself go over
But holding back for me
No matter how much you want it
How much it <i>hurts</i>
Because it's what I want
Edge #PetName @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Every time you get close like that
It hurts just a little bit more, doesn't it #PetName?
[yes] Mmmmm
[no] I will soon, I promise you
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no #SubName?
Your #Cock is #Gonna reach a point
A very desperate...
Very achey point
Where your desire to please me will be challenged
By the absolute <i>need</i> in every little frustrated inch
Edge again @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
The beautiful thing is
It doesn't matter #PetName
It doesn't matter if you could handle another 20 edges for me
Or if you couldn't handle another single stroke
Because that #Cock between your legs doesn't belong to you anymore
It belongs to me
Edge @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Pain
Pleasure
Relief
Agony
Those words don't mean anything to your cock #SubName
Not anymore
The only words that matter to that cock are the words on your screen right now
My words
My will
Edge, and be ready to hold it @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
From now own, the only pain you will truly feel
Is the pain of disappointing me
The only pleasure you will truly feel
Is the pleasure of making me happy
Rest while you can and think about that
Because you'll start stroking again soon enough
And no matter how much agony you're in
Or how badly you need relief, you'll wrap those fingers around that #Cock
And you'll stroke
Just to make me happy #EmoteHappy

@Info The domme makes you edge a few times back to back, while reinforcing the idea that your pain threshold and desperation don't matter compared to making her happy. Written by 1885.
