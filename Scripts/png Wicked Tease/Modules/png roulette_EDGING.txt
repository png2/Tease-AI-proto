I wonder if you're a gambler... #Grin
And if you are, what could I make you bet for some release... #lol
I have a game I call the <i>orgasm roulette</i> #Emote
It's pretty easy
I'll tell you the odds you have to cum
The lower the chance, the easier the losing tasks will be
And of course the higher the chance, the harder they'll be #Grin
But to be more fun, you won't know what the losing wager is #lol
For example, I could give you a 10% chance to cum but if you lose I'll make you edge 2 times or maybe hit your cock a few times
Quite easy
But if I offer you a 50% chance to orgasm, the losing end could be no touching for 3 days
Each time I offer you odds, you can refuse it and I'll raise it
But I'll never lower it #lol
And of course if you reach the highest odds, you can't refuse any more #Grin
So choose wisely... @SetFlag(png__roulette_rules)

But that's too bad since your orgasms are already restricted. you cannot play now! #Grin

But I don't want to so we'll never know #lol

@Info The dom asks you to play the orgasm roulette. She gives you a chance to cum. If you play she rolls the roulette and determines your fate. If you refuse the odds she will make them higher. The higher the odd the worse the punishment if you lose. What are you willing to risk to get an early release? This script ignores all your orgasm/ruining settings except if you are never allowed to orgasm. The goal is to give you a potentially very costly exit door if you get ready to bet on your release :)
