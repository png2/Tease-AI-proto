@NullResponse @StopTaunts @CheckFlag(png__roulette_rules,png__toss_freedom_rules)
I wonder if you're a gambler... #Grin
Anf if you are, what could I make you bet for some release... #lol
I have a game I call the <i>orgasm roulette</i>
It's a pretty fun game but since you are locked up you cannot play it #Grin
(roulette_check_play)
But that doesn't mean we can't gamble for your freedom #Grin
@NullResponse @NullResponse @If[#OrgasmLockDate]=['later']Then(roulette_ask_play)
But since your orgasms are already restricted you don't have any gambling chip I'm interrested in #Grin
So that's just a wasted opportunity for you I guess
Still making you realize that you could have been free is always fun #lol

I wonder if right now you are desperate enough to try to bet your freedom in a 'toss a coin from freedom' game #grin

As you know I really like the orgasms roulette
Since you are locked up we can't play it #EmoteSad @Goto(roulette_check_play)
(roulette_ask_play)
Alright let's call this one 'toss a coin for freedom' #Grin 
It's a lot easier than roulette, you simply have a 50/50 chance to get free
But if you loose you'll stay locked up and I'll limit your orgasms...
It means that even if I free you later you will have a limited amount of possible orgasms until the fixed period is over @SetFlag(png__toss_freedom_rules)
(roulette_play)
Do you want to play #PetName?
[yes]Either you like to gamble or you are very very desperate to get out of that #ChastityCage #lol
[no]Oh it seems I need to make you even more frustrated then #EmoteHappy @Goto(refuse)
@DifferentAnswer yes or no?
Either way it's fine with me
Let's toss... @Wait(20) @Chance50(lost)
Damn!
You won #EmoteSad
Lucky you I guess...
You can unlock your cage @ChastityOff
(cage_off_lopp)
@Wait(30)
Are you ready to continue?
[yes]Let's do it then
[no]I thought you'd be faster than that to get out @Goto(cage_off_lopp)
@DifferentAnswer Maybe I should just keep you locked in the end... @Goto(cage_off_lopp)
But I still get to tease you #Grin
@End
(refuse)
I'm sure it will seem a much better idea to you in a few more days of being locked #Grin
@End
(lost)
Congratulation!
You lost!!! #lol
Now I'll take your orgasms away even when you are not locked up #Grin 
I want you to go to my settings
In the 'Domme' tab in the top right side you'll find the options for your orgasms @GotoDommeApathy
(ApathyLevel1)
I want you to check the 'limit' box and set 2 orgasms per week @Goto(locking_done)
(ApathyLevel2)
I want you to check the 'limit' box and set 1 orgasm per week @Goto(locking_done)
(ApathyLevel3)
I want you to check the 'limit' box and set 1 orgasm per 2 weeks @Goto(locking_done)
(ApathyLevel4)
I want you to check the 'limit' box and set 2 orgasm per month @Goto(locking_done)
(ApathyLevel5)
I want you to check the 'limit' box and set 1 orgasm per month @Goto(locking_done)
(locking_done)
Then click on the 'locked selected' button and accept the warning message #EmoteHappy
Now that should nicely reduce your chances of cumming
Not like you had any as long as I keep you locked up #Grin
Well...
It seems we are done gambling and now you lost your only betting chip for a while #lol

@Info If your orgasms are not limited, the dom will propose to bet them to get free of the cage. you have a 50/50 chance. If you loose she'll restrict your orgasms, the number and duration depends on the apathy level
