Stop stroking @StopStroking @CheckFlag(NoAvoidTheEdgeInstructions)
I want to play a little game with you #PetName
I call it Avoid The Edge #EmoteHappy
The rules are pretty simple really
I'm going to pick one of your porn videos for you to watch
And you have to stroke the entire time it's playing
The thing is though...
I don't want you to edge, I only want you to stroke
But if you can't help yourself, and you <i>do</i> get close, just tell me
And I'll pause the video while I cool you down a little
And just for the record
That may not be as pleasant as it sounds #Grin
All you have to do to win is make it through the whole video
And don't worry about losing
I'll make sure you won't #Lol
So now that you know the rules @SetFlag(NoAvoidTheEdgeInstructions)
@NullResponse @SetVar[png__avoid_edge_counter]=[0]
Let's play #Grin @PlayAvoidTheEdge
You made it!
Pretty fun game, right?
[yes] I'm glad you think so #PetName
[was fun] I'm glad you think so #PetName
[no] That's kind of a shame #PetName
[wasn't fun, wasn't, not fun, was not fun] That's kind of a shame #PetName
@DifferentAnswer C'mon #PetName, yes or no?
Cause we'll be playing a lot more of that, I'm sure #Grin
But for now
I have something else in mind
@End
(NoAvoidTheEdgeInstructions)
I want to play Avoid The Edge with you again
Up for it? #EmoteHappy
[yes] I was hoping you'd say that #Grin
[no] That's okay #PetName @Goto(That's Okay)
@DifferentAnswer Yes or no #PetName?
@NullResponse @SetVar[png__avoid_edge_counter]=[0]
Let's get started @PlayAvoidTheEdge
You made it!
That was fun #EmoteHappy
Next time I'll find an even better video for you to stroke to #Grin 
@If[png__avoid_edge_counter]=[0]Then(no_edge) 
@NullResponse @NullResponse @SetVar[png_domlevel]=[#DomLevel]
But don't think I forgot those @ShowVar[png__avoid_edge_counter] edges...
You realize that the point of this little task is to avoid them, right? #lol @GotoDommeApathy
(ApathyLevel1)
Since I am a #Kind #DomHonorific, I'll let you off the hook this time #Grin
@End
(ApathyLevel2)
I'll let you off the hook this time, but I might not be so #Kind next time
@End
(ApathyLevel3)
I want you to slap that #Cock of yours @ShowVar[png__avoid_edge_counter] times!
Yes once per edge #PetName
@End
(ApathyLevel4)
@NullResponse @ChangeVar[png__avoid_edge_counter]=[png__avoid_edge_counter]*[png_domlevel]
I want you to slap that #Cock of yours @ShowVar[png__avoid_edge_counter] times!
Don't whine you know you deserve it! #Grin
@End
(ApathyLevel5)
@NullResponse @ChangeVar[png__avoid_edge_counter]=[png__avoid_edge_counter]*[png_domlevel]*2
I want you to slap that #Cock of yours @ShowVar[png__avoid_edge_counter] times!
And make them count!
Did you think I would let you misbehave like that without retribution? #lol
@End
(no_edge) 
But I'm still proud of you since you didn't edge this time! #EmoteHappy
@End
(That's Okay)
I have plenty of other ways to make you squirm #Grin
