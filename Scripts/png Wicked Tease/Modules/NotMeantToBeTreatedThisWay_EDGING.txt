#LetTheEdgeFade
You know, if you're being honest with yourself
Deep down there has to be a part of you that knows this is wrong
Physically, I mean
That your body wasn't meant to work this way
Your #Cock wasn't meant to ache so much
And your balls just weren't meant to hold so much cum
I mean
Stroking is supposed to feel <i>good</i>, right? #Lol
But instead, well
Why don't you edge for me real quick and see for yourself #Grin @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
See what I mean though?
Sometimes I think I've got you so worked up you can't even think straight #Lol
And if I'm being honest with <i>myself</i>
It turns me on so much knowing what I can do to you
And what I can make you do to yourself #Grin
Like those poor, sensitive balls for instance @CBTBalls
I mean, fuck...
Balls were <i>absolutely</i> not meant to be treated that way
And yet, you do it just because I want you to #EmoteHappy
You'll suffer any way I want
And that makes me feel sexier than you can possibly imagine
And I promise you
I'm #Gonna make sure your #Cock feels every ounce of my arousal
Every degree of my heat
And every bit of my wickedness
I just can't promise it will enjoy it #Grin

@Info The domme makes you edge and smack your balls a bit while teasing you about how sexy it makes her feel when you go against your body's nature. Written by 1885.
