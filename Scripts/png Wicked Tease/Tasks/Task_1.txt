@DommeLevel4 As soon as you get a chance, I want you to stroke to the edge as fast as you can. Make sure you keep track of how long it takes to get there! Your first task today is to beat that record 10 times by getting to the edge faster than you did the previous time. You can try this as many times as it takes #GeneralTime, but I want you to wait at least 3 minutes between each attempt.

@DommeLevel1 Your first task for me today is to stroke yourself 10 times. Yep, just 10 sad little strokes. Doesn't really seem fair to that #Cock, does it? #Grin Well that's okay, because you're #Gonna wait at least 5 minutes and then stroke it 10 more times than you did the last time, so 20 strokes. You're going to do this for me until you reach 50 strokes at once, then the task will be complete.
