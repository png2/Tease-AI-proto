I wonder how long a guy can go without orgasm before he absolutely HAS to cum?
@Bratty That sounds like a fun experiement!
@Bratty One way to find out!
@Bratty If you want any help finding out... I volunteer
@Cruel I still wouldn't let him
@Cruel Why not just keep him denied permanently and be done with it?
@Cruel Does any guy truly HAVE to cum? I don't think so
@Caring Surely not more than a day or two?
@Caring A better question would be how long could I go before I absolutely have to MAKE him cum?
@Caring I still it's a waste to play with a nice cock and not let it cum when you're finished
@Angry What kind of question is that?! You should ALWAYS make him cum!
@Angry You realize you sound like a mad scientist, right?
@Angry What happens if he breaks something in there?
