I heard there's a city called Rome on every continent. Is that true?
Who the hell lives in Rome, Antarctica?
I guess they wanted to make sure all roads really did lead to Rome lol
Even Antarctica?
I don't think so
Yeah no, made up shit like that is just how people trolled each other before the internet
