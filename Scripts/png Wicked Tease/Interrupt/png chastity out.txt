@NullResponse @CheckStrokingState
(ApathyLevel2)
I wonder if you have been good enough to be free...
Do you thing you did?
[yes] Ok, then let's free you for now #PetName #EmoteHappy @ChastityOff @TempFlag(png__chastityoff_tmp)
[no] Hmmm and you want me to free you? I need to think about it @Wait(20) 
@DifferentAnswer Yes or No?

@NullResponse @Goto(stay_in_chastity_lvl3)
(ApathyLevel4)
But I don't think you deserve to be free... 
In fact I don't really care about what you think... 
I'm the only one who decide of your fate! #Grin @Chance25(punishment) @Goto(stay_in_chastity_lvl4)
(ApathyLevel5)
No way I'll let you free!
I am the one who decide your fate
(punishment)
In fact you deserve punishment for asking such a silly thing! @AFKOn @WritingTask(I should be grateful to be in chastity for #DomName)
Still want to get out #PetName? #lol @AFKOff 
[yes]Oh I guess you didn't learn that lesson then @Goto(punishment2)
[no]Good
@DifferentAnswer Do you or not?
I knew you could learn when you put your mind to it! #Grin

Wow not only you ask to get out but you fail the punishment... @AFKOff 
Get out of my sight for today, I don't want to see you again for a while!

(punishment2)
Go get a wooden spoon, a hairbrush, a spatula or something like that...
And hit your balls #Random(5,10) times with it! Make each one count!
(loop_punishment)
@NullResponse @Wait(60)
Done?
[yes]Good, I hope you are crying right now...
[no]You are too slow! That means 5 more slaps @Goto(loop_punishment)
@DifferentAnswer Can't you answer by yes or no? That means 5 more slaps to teach you @Goto(loop_punishment)

[yes]Let's do it then
[no]I thought you'd be faster than that to get out @Goto(cage_off_lopp)
@DifferentAnswer Maybe I should just keep you locked in the end... @Goto(cage_off_lopp)
Since you are free I guess you can start stroking for now @DeleteFlag(png__chastityoff_tmp) @StartStroking
