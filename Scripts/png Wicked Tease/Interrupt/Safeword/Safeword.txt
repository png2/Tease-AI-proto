Stop everything you're doing #SubName.
If you are wearing a cage, take it off @ChastityOff
It's okay, just relax for me *smile*
Thank you for letting me know you needed to stop by using your safeword
I do love tormenting you, but the most important thing to me is that you feel safe and secure
Do you think you're done for the time being?
[yes] That is absolutely okay #PetName
[no] I admire your courage #Grin @Goto(Not Done Yet)
@DifferentAnswer I need to be very clear #SubName, do you want to stop for now? It's okay if you do, but I need to know yes or no
I pushed you to the limit, and I know you were hanging in there to please me
I am so proud of you #SubName #EmoteHappy
I just wish I could be there with you right now so I could hold you in my arms
Let you feel how happy you make me, and how much pleasure you give me
Why don't you do relax for a little while #PetName?
You could play a game, or just do something to recharge yourself
And don't worry
I'll be right here when you;re ready to find me again #Grin
Go take care of yourself #PetName
I'll see you soon @EndTease

I'm very proud of you for using your safeword when you needed to
That makes me very happy, that we have that kind of trust together
Because I know I was pushing you close to your limit
Which is why I'm <i>very</i> impressed that you want to keep going for me
I'll make sure you don't regret that decision
<i>too</i> much #Grin
